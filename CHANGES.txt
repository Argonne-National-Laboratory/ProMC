  See changes in proto.sh
  Also, source files are generated for each case in 
  src/promc/ src/pronlo src/proreco 
  Java browser was modified to include HepSim commands

ProMC 1.4
  Support for zip64. 
  By default, only zip32 is supported (max 65k events, 4GB limit)
  You can set the option "inMemory" during the initialization
  which will use zip64 which does not have this limit.

  The zip64 format is detected at runtime (when reading).
  For writing in zip64, use the constructor:
  new ProMCBook("out/output.promc","w",true);
  It creates zip in memory and writes at the end. This mode is good
  for small "events", but you can write any number of such events.
