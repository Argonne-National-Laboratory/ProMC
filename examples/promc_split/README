This is a program to split ProMC files.
======================================
July 2013


Example:
promc_split file.promc 10  # split the file into 10 files in the directory out/

If you use non-standard layout of data, first do:

1) promc_proto file.promc # extracts ProtoBuff layouts 
2) promc_code             # generates C++ headers 
3) make                   # compiles the split program               
4) ./promc_split file.promc 10 # creates 10 files from the original in the directory out/

You do not need the steps 1-3 when splitting files which have exactly the same stracture as the previus file.
